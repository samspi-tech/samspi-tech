# 👋 Hey there
Thank you for visiting my Github! 
My name is Andrea, and I began my journey 
as a web developer by learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
through Udemy and FreeCodeCamp courses. </br>
Discovering how much I enjoyed coding, I decided 
to take my skills further and enrolled 
in the Epicode Web Developer Part-Time Bootcamp, 
all while working a full-time job.

During the program, I worked on numerous projects 
both independently and in collaboration with my classmates, 
gaining hands-on experience and problem-solving skills.
After eight intensive months of study and practice, 
I successfully completed the program.

Now, with a solid foundation in web development, 
I’m continuing to expand my knowledge, 
explore new technologies, 
and refine my skills through self-directed learning.
